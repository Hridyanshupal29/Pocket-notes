# Pocket-notes
This is a react project(Notes taking app) which I made with the help of learn.cuvette.tech. 


Features List:
- User should be able to create group for notes
- User should be able to add notes in a particular group
- User should be able save the note by pressing Enter key or clicking on the Enter icon in the text input
- You need to save the notes in localstorage, every notes and group should persist on page reload
- As soon as the user changes the group, you need to fetch all the notes related to that particular group
- You also need to save meta data like date and time when the notes was saved and last updated.
